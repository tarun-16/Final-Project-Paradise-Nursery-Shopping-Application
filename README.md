Setup description from the course (slightly modified for my own project) in the IBM Cloud IDE:

Clone repository
Change terminal path to folder "paradise-nursery-shopping-cart-app". E.g.:
```code cd Final-Project-Paradise-Nursery-Shopping-Application```
Install necessary packages to execute the application using npm:
```code npm install```
Execute this command to run the application, which will start the application server running on port number 4173.
In IBM Cloud IDE there was an extra feature for this, where the port was entered and the application was started.
```code npm run preview```
